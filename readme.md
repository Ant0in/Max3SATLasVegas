# 🔎 Max 3-SAT Las Vegas Solver

Welcome to my **Max 3-SAT Las Vegas Solver** project! This project is part of the **Randomized Algorithms INFO-F413** course at `ULB`. It implements a **Max 3-SAT solver** using a **randomized Las Vegas algorithm**, providing an efficient probabilistic approach for finding assignments that maximize the number of satisfied clauses.

## 📜 Description

This Python project provides:

- A **Max 3-SAT solver** based on a **randomized Las Vegas algorithm**.
- A full implementation of **literals, clauses, and Boolean assignments** for 3-CNF formulas.
- Methods to **evaluate**, **optimize**, and **search** for assignments that guarantees the number of satisfied clauses is at least `7m/8`.

For more detailed problem specifications and additional information, please refer to the project specification [**`doc/SatisfactionAssignment-1.pdf`**](doc/SatisfactionAssignment-1.pdf) or to the report.

## ⚙️ Installation

To install the project locally, clone the repository and move into its directory:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Ant0in/Max3SATLasVegas.git
cd Max3SATLasVegas
```

## 🚀 Use the Solver

The project works from the command line and supports two modes:

1. **Single-file mode** – run the Las Vegas MAX-3SAT solver on one `.cnf` instance.  
2. **Batch mode** – run the solver on every `.cnf` file inside a directory.

Both modes accept optional parameters such as the maximum number of iterations and verbosity.

---

### 📄 Single File

To run the solver on a single CNF file:

```bash
python main.py --file res/example.cnf --verbose
```

This loads the instance, applies the Las Vegas MAX-3SAT algorithm, and prints:

- The best number of **satisfied clauses** found,
- Its **proportion** relative to the *total clause count*,
- (with `--verbose`) The Boolean assignment that achieved it.

### 📂 Directory of Instances

To automatically process every `.cnf` file inside a folder:

```bash
python main.py --dir res/
```

The solver iterates over all matching files and reports the best result for each.

## 📝 Example of Accepted CNF Format

The solver expects files in standard **`DIMACS CNF` format** (as commonly used in SAT competitions).
A typical 3-SAT instance looks like this:

```bash
c This Formular is generated by mcnf
c
c    horn? no 
c    forced? no 
c    mixed sat? no 
c    clause length = 3 
c
p cnf 20 91
-10 -16 5 0
16 -6 5 0
-17 -14 -18 0
...
3 -9 8 0
%
0
```

- Lines beginning with `c` are **comments**.
- The line `p cnf <num_vars> <num_clauses>` declares the problem.
- Each clause is a **list of integers** ending with `0`.
- Negative integers represent **negated literals**.

Any `.cnf` file placed in the `res/` directory following this structure will be correctly parsed by the solver.

## 📊 Benchmarks

Standard **MAX-3SAT benchmark instances** can be found at the **SATLIB** repository: https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html
